(This particular PULL is going to be one of the hardest and most Time-Consuming, self-coordinated volunteer-effort attempt at an IT-architectural web-based [WWW.COM] of my American-Reform Blue-Print Design: (STYLE) Free-Mason Political Block-Building. Simply by directly relaying command of judicial powers within my jurisdiction to alter our system through task-forcing with IT logistics, using my very own (novice)  Personal Coding-Style.)

# [Veteran Demployment Experimental Medic-Unit]
* I HIRE VETERANS: the beta-testing of home-visitation test run, employers of the VA will need to hire pre-selected Veteran for immediate demployment, in order to properly test the success ratings of the provided aid. This vet will not be bound in any kind of employment contract or any other type of obligation that calls for him to continue to serve after arranged demployment, for this political science testing data-research.
* CALL TO SERVE: there is no legal need to provide any type of heads up letter or documentation that is a pre-appointed date set for the Veteran's immediate call to serve the temporary trial-run. This is not a part of the [EEOA] and should be overseen by current VA staff throughout the entire 24-hour agenda.

# Feline-Aids to Veteran Officers for Veterans' Suicide-Prevention
* Trained Feline Pet-Aid: all too often felines are taken for granted, or underestimated as unfit or not-qualified to be a "Service-Animal." In statistics of many research papers that have studied feline and distressed person interactions during counseling sessions, and in general studies, cats are often very successful at easing patient anxiety and stress-based disorders, as well as the feline's ability to coax severely depressed individuals out of deepend and prolonged states of emotional-disturbances. Statitics show a definite potential for felines to serve along side Vet-Troopers as one of few animal trademark tools, and could possibly serve as a cute, fuzzy, soft and cuddly deteurant that can be added to a Veteran-Trooper's non-violence, pro-life based arsenal.
